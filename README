Welcome to my CS373 Project
To run this project, make sure you have docker installed and updated
Also, make sure to turn off any services using the ports 3306 or 3000

There is no need to install node as that will be done inside a vm

Once you are ready, navigate to this folder in terminal and run the following scripts
1. docker-build.sh
2. run.sh

This will create the docker container and insert you into the command line of the vm
It is running a version of debian (I think)

From here, you can run any of the install scripts using `node install (table)`
though it is recommended that they are run in the order found in order.txt to avoid
foreign key errors.

Then, when you would like to leave, type `exit` and then run stop.sh
