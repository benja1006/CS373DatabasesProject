Welcome to my CS373 Project
To run this project, make sure you have docker installed and updated
Also, make sure to turn off any services using the ports 3306 or 3000

There is no need to install node as that will be done inside a vm

Once you are ready, navigate to this folder in terminal and run the following scripts
1. ./docker-build.sh
2. ./run.sh

This will create the docker container and start the program. All access is done
via a webpage hosted at localhost:3000. It should automatically open, but if
it says webpage not found just wait a few seconds then reload the page.

From here, you can run any of the insert scripts by clicking the insert button
at the bottom of the screen. The dropdown allows you to choose what table to insert.
I recommend you insert them in the order given to avoid foreign key errors.
The button auto increments to the next table, so you can just press the button 5 times.

Once the database is populated, you can run queries using the forms on the right

Then, when you would like to leave, go back to the terminal window and run ./stop.sh

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions, or if anything breaks
